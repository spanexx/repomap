## Risks & Blockers

### Current Risks

1. **Over-engineering the Framework**
   - Risk: Spending too much time on generalization
   - Status: Identified
   - Mitigation: Keep it simple; only generalize what's needed

2. **Breaking Repomap During Refactoring**
   - Risk: Introducing bugs while refactoring existing code
   - Status: Identified
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing + incremental refactoring

### Current Blockers

- Blocked by Milestone 1.1 completion

---

## Notes

- Milestone start depends on Milestone 1.1 completion
- Can run in parallel with Milestone 1.3 (Testing) after initial framework is done
- Framework design should be reviewed early with team feedback

## Next Update

Progress.md will be updated weekly during development.
