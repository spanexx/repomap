# Milestone 1.5: Visualizer UI Optimization

## Overview
This milestone focuses on paying down technical debt in the Frontend (`visualizer-ui`). The goal is to adhere to the component modularization guidelines, making the code easier to maintain and extend. We will also perform a polish pass to ensure "premium" aesthetics.

## Goals
1.  **Modularization**: Break down large components (`Sidebar`, `App`, `Chat`).
2.  **Logic Extraction**: Move side-effects and data fetching into custom React hooks.
3.  **Context Awareness**: Empower the AI with UI state (selected files, active view) to assist in planning.
4.  **Aesthetics**: Refine UI/UX with better spacing, typography, and transitions.

## Deliverables
-   Refactored `src/components/` directory.
-   New `src/hooks/` directory.
-   Fully responsive layout.
