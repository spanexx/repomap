## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Container overhead | Medium | Low | Benchmark early and often |
| Language toolchain availability | Medium | Medium | Use standard Docker images |
| Resource leaks | High | Medium | Implement monitoring and cleanup |
| Network isolation complexity | Low | Low | Start with simple isolation |
